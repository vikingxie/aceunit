/** Java-like exceptions for C.
 * This is part of AceUnit but can also be used without AceUnit.
 *
 * Example:
 * <pre>
 * \#define SomeException 1
 * int someMethod() throws(SomeException) {
 *     if (someCondition) {
 *         throw(SomeException);
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * int someCaller() {
 *     try {
 *         someMethod();
 *     } catch (SomeException) {
 *         // handle this exception
 *     } endtry;
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * Differences to Java
 * - Exceptions are only int values.
 * - endtry MUST not be omitted.
 * - Omitting the {} block at try or catch will eventually not be detected by the compiler but lead to extremely strange behaviour.
 * - throw has a slightly different syntax.
 * - throws has a slightly different syntax and currently no effect.
 * - there are no checked exceptions, i.e. exception handling cannot be enforced.
 *
 * Similarities with Java
 * - You can have more than one catch clause per try.
 * - You can have zero or more catch clauses per try. Yes, having zero catch clauses is allowed. But unlike Java this doesn't make sense in C.
